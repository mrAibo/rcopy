# rcopy - Remote Copy Tool

**rcopy** is a versatile and powerful Bash function designed for efficient and customizable copying of files and directories, both locally and between remote systems. Leveraging the capabilities of `rsync`, `scp`, and additional features like compression, file exclusion, and bandwidth control, **rcopy** aims to simplify and enhance the process of data transfer.

## Installation

Due to its comprehensive functionality, **rcopy** is best sourced from outside your `.bashrc` file to keep your shell configuration clean and fast. You can source the script whenever needed or in specific scripts that require its functionality.

1. Clone the repository or download the `rcopy.sh` script to your preferred location.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mrAibo/rcopy.git
```

2. Source the script in your terminal or within a script:

```bash
source /path/to/rcopy.sh
```

## Features

- **Versatile Copying**: Copy files and directories locally or to/from remote systems.
- **Compression**: Compress data during transfer to save bandwidth.
- **File Exclusion**: Exclude files using patterns or an exclude file.
- **Bandwidth Control**: Limit transfer speed.
- **SSH Options**: Specify SSH port, identity file, and username.
- **Sync Mode**: Synchronize files between two remote servers.
- **Verbosity Control**: Show detailed progress information.

## Usage

```bash
rcopy [OPTIONS] source destination
```

### Examples

**Basic Examples**

- Copy a local directory:

```bash
rcopy ~/documents/project /backup/
```

```

- Copy from a remote server:

```bash
rcopy user@server:/remote/data ~/local/
```

**Advanced Examples**

- Compress and move with verbose output:

```bash
rcopy -z -m -v ~/large-project server:/backup/
```

- Exclude log files and use custom SSH port:

```bash
rcopy -e "*.log" -p 2222 ~/project user@server:/backup/
```
